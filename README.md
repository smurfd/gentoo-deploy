READ THE SCRIPTS AND CFG FILE.<br>
Modify according to your needs<br>

I mean its made for me mostly, but could maby be used by someone else if they know what they are doing.<br>
<br>
Please, give it a shot in a VirtualMachine first<br>
(anything happens after you download the 1st script... ITS YOUR FAULT!)<br>
